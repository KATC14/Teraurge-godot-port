I want the debug functions, but I recognize that when I use these tools designed for content creation, I might very likely break the dialogue scripting and render quest lines incompletable and/or break my savegame. I will not send bug reports to meandraco.gamedev@gmail.com when I use the debug tools because Meandraco doesn't want to spend hours looking for bugs that are caused by irresponsible use of the debug tools.
