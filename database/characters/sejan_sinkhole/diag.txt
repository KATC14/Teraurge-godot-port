||>>INSIDE SINK HOLE HUB
{succ_3 | play_sound sejan/sinkhole_collapse 70, pic chamber} Before you can think of what to do next, the ground surrounding you completely gives away and collapses into the dark pit below you.<br><br>You fall for less than a second before slamming into the ground below the ground. You're in a chamber revealed by the collapsed ground.
{look | pic chamber} You look around but can't see much. Behind you, the wall has a few roots sticking you that you might be able to climb. All you can tell is that, from the acoustics of the chamber, outside of the the small lit area you're standing in, the chamber extends significantly in front of you. 
{torch | play_sound generic/objects/torch 70, give_money krats 38} With the torch lit, you can now see that you're standing in a simple empty chamber. The only thing you see besides a few jutting rocks and roots are several krats stuck to the ground.<br><br>You take the krats off the ground. You count 38. 
{climb_down2 | pic chamber} Using the roots on the wall, you climb down into the sink-hole.
