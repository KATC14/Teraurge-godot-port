||>>Day
{start_day | save_index visited} The market is full of activity. Most of the stalls on both sides are occupied by merchants selling their wares to locals and visitors alike. A couple of people are carrying crates from the pier, and you can see a small ring of people in the sidelines discussing trade deals. You browse the different goods on sale for a while. For the most part, it's just basic goods like raw materials, tools, food, or clothes, but there's also the odd artifact or mechanical contraption you don't recognize.
{day} The market is bustling and full of people.
{nothing_found} You tour the market but don't find anything of interest.
{vuisul_busy} You try to get Vuisul's attention, but she seems to be too busy arguing with merchants to answer.
