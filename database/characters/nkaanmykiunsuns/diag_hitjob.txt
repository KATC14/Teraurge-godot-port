||>>Out of town
{start | stop_music 6, change_environment taodal_entrance, change_sprite normal, add_flag nkaanmykiunsuns_hitjob} You follow Nkaanmykiunsuns out of the tavern, through the town, and out of the gates.
	[perp_forest] The murderer is in the forest?
||
{perp_forest} "Yes. We are going to need to wait for dark."
	[why_not_slit] You're going to slit his throat while he's sleeping?
||
{why_not_slit} "I use a mallet and a dagger to make a hole in the side of the skull if possible. Less mess and noise that way."
{slit_hassle} "Poking a hole through the perp's nervous system is a more reliable way to kill them fast. The vein placement varies so much that just slitting someone's throat doesn't guarantee a kill.<br><br>For example, my jugulars run on the inside of a bony throat, and slitting my throat would not be that effective."
	[slit_hassle] Why? Wouldn't slitting their throat be less of a hassle? //showif.index_is.why_not_slit //showif.has_stat.intelligence.6
	[use_pick] ...Couldn't you just use a pick? //showif.has_stat.intelligence.8
	[okay_job] Okay.
||
{use_pick | character_leave} "I... guess?... Huh, I need to remember that. Come, follow." She motions you to follow and starts walking.
{okay_job | character_leave} "Come, follow." She motions you to follow and starts walking.
	[at_the_job | advance_time_to night] (Follow her)

||>>Arriving to the job site
{at_the_job | change_environment sejan_witch_house, change_sprite normal, auto_continue this_place} You venture into the forest and then wait. After the dark has fallen, you continue.<br><br>As you keep following her through the jungle, a feeling of familiarity strokes you. You've seen these trees before. She stops at the edge of a clearing and points at a hut on a hill.
||
{this_place} "Be very quiet."
{nod_yes} She nods.
{nod_yes2} She nods.
{why_murder} "They stabbed a man in the neck, from behind.<br><br>It might seem excessive, sending an assassin after a petty murderer, but this one is a special case."
{how_know_murder} "There's a recording of the act and a witness... Hey, -name-, It's okay. I ask myself these things every time too, but I promise this serves a purpose. Don't lose your nerve."

	[why_murder] Who did they murder and why? //hideif.clicked
	[descript_perp] Your target is a pale female with a skull-looking face and no lower jaw?
	[i_know_her] ...I know her.
	[need_to_stop] I can't let you kill her.
	[go_kill_her] Go do your thing, I'll keep the watch.
||

||>>Normal job
{go_kill_her} "Not so quick, few things." She hands you a small box with a single button.
	[instruct_1] What is this?
||
{instruct_1} "It's an alarm. You press it and my button alerts me. You keep watch, and if anything out of the ordinary happens, you don't yell or run to the house, you just press that button and lay low."
	[instruct_2] What do you mean by 'out of ordinary'? Are you expecting something?
||
{instruct_2} "I- I am not sure. If a braq approaches the house, press the button, if a tree suddenly falls down, press the button, if you see odd lights, press the button, weird noises, button. Get it?"
	[instruct_3] ...Okay, I think I get it.
||
{instruct_3} "And, if you see me running from the house, you start running too. If the house suddenly bursts into flames, run away. Don't try to help me if I seem to be in trouble, okay? You're here to click the button in case it needs to be clicked. It gives me some warning if something is happening."
	[hard_follow] 'Not helping you' is going to be a hard one to follow. //showif.charisma.8
	[instruct_4] Okay.
||
{hard_follow} "I'm serious."
	[hard_follow_serious] I'm serious too.
||
{hard_follow_serious} "Uh huh, it will get you killed. Right, I think that's all. I'm going to go now and do my thing." She glances at the house.
{instruct_4} "Right, I think that's all. I'm going to go now and do my thing." She glances at the house.
	[instruct_5] Go ahead.
	[instruct_5] Good luck.
||
{instruct_5 | character_leave} "See you in a bit." She crouches and starts crawling up the hill.
	[job_wait_1] (Wait)
||
{job_wait_1} You can barely make out her silhouette in the dark as she quickly and deftly weaves through rocks and grass on the hill until she stops at the door and crouches next to it. A moment later, she slowly opens the door and disappears inside.<br><br>An eerie silence falls on the hill. You stare into the edge of the forest and glance around you. Everything seems calm and normal.
	[job_wait_2] (Wait)
||
{job_wait_2} The rustling leaves bathe the silence in pleasant noise as the wind slightly picks up. You can't see any trace of Nkaan yet. The house is completely static. The shadows in the tree line flicker and slide over each other as the trees wave in the wind. 
	[oki_job] (Wait)
||

{need_to_stop | add_flag nkaanmykiunsuns_pc_knows_witch} She stares at you with shock in her eyes. "You... know her!"

	[yeah_sirius] Yes.
	[yeah_sirius] Well, I don't know her that well.
||
{yeah_sirius} She rubs her temples. "How do I get myself into garbage like this... "
	[do_your_job] If what you say is true, I'm not going to defend her. Do your job.
	[need_her_help] I can't let you kill her. I need her.
	[no_kill_please] I'm not going to let you hurt her.

{do_your_job} "Sure! <b>Fucking fuck</b>! It's not your fault of course, but god damn am I frustrated. Right... <br><br>I'm going to do this without a second guy, then."
	[want_leave] Do you want me to leave?
||
{want_leave} She pulls a long dagger on you. "No, you're staying here. I've pulled enough knives from my back to learn not to leave unclear actors on the table."
	[u_kill_me] What? You're going to kill me?
	[woah_wait] Woah! Wait a second! We can talk this out! 
||
{woah_wait} "Of course, I would just like to tie you up until the job is done. The dagger is just a precaution."
{u_kill_me} "I would rather not. I would just like to tie you up until the job is done."
{dont_trust} "We barely know each other, you know that. I just need to remove you from the situation.<br><br>Look... I'll even buy you a drink after, if you co-operate."
	[dont_trust] You don't trust me? //hideif.index_is.dont_trust
	[surrender] I understand, go ahead. (Surrender)
	[not_let_you] I'm not going to let you tie me up.
||
{not_let_you} "It's just a precaution."
	[not_let_you_2] I'm not going to let you tie me up, even as a precaution.
	[surrender] Alright, sure, go ahead. (Surrender)
||
{not_let_you_2} "You're not serious! C'mon! Do I actually need to fight you to make you comply?"
	[not_let_you_3] You're not tying me up.
	[surrender] Sorry, I'm being an ass. Here, tie me up. (Surrender)
||
{not_let_you_3} "Fuck you!" She readies herself for the fight.
	[ | start_music sejan_taodal/nkaanmykiunsuns_fight 70, start_combat nkaan_frendo_win pc_frendo_win] (Fight her)
	[surrender_oshit] Shit. Wait! I changed my mind! Tie me up, please! (Surrender)
||>>Surrender
{surrender_oshit | pic tied_up} She snarls, annoyed. "You little shit." She approaches carefully with her dagger ready and takes a black rope from her bag which she quickly loops over your wrists. After a flurry of professional efficiency, you suddenly find yourself hogtied on the ground.

	[wait_you] Would it bother you if I said this turns me on?
	[wait_you] I'll just wait for you here.
||
{wait_you | pic stab_scare} Before you manage to utter anything, she shoves an improvised gag in your mouth and ties it around your head. She crouches next to you and you feel a cold edge on your throat. "Naive and trusting, aren't we?" She yanks your head to the side and pokes your neck with the point of her knife. "Just a quick stab and you're done." She raises her knife with the intent of driving into it into your neck.
	[escape_eyeroll] Roll your eyes at her. //showif.will.10
	[rope_escape_mumble] What the fuck? Why?!
	[rope_escape] (Roll dodge)

{rope_escape_mumble | remove_pic} You yell through the gag at her.<br><br>Nkaanmykiunsuns gently slaps you on the cheek with the flat side of the dagger, hops up, and grins. "I'm fucking with you!<br><br>Thanks. I owe you a drink. I'll be back in a moment." She leaves and disappears into the night.
{rope_escape | remove_pic} The ropes incapacitate you to a degree that they render your action into ineffectual thrashing.<br><br>Nkaanmykiunsuns gently slaps you on the cheek with the flat side of the dagger, hops up, and grins.

{escape_eyeroll | remove_pic , character_leave} She plunges the knife within a hair's breadth of your neck and then hops up and grins. You look at her and roll your eyes dismissively. "Hah!

	[pc_win_rubitin] I thought you were better at this.
	[pc_win_rubitin] You're pretty good.
||
{pc_win_rubitin} Nkaan gets up. "We could have just... We didn't have to fight. You could have just let me tie you up."
	[no_ropes] I don't like getting tied up.
	[hurt_too_bad] I didn't hurt you too bad, did I?
||
{no_ropes} "No, apparently you do not." She cracks her neck.
{hurt_too_bad} "I'm going to be sore later, but I can do my job still." She cracks her neck.

{nkaan_frendo_win | start_music sejan_taodal/nkaanmykiunsuns_fight_end 70 0 0 no_loop, pic tied_up} You fall backwards from her attack. You try to get back up, but she knees you in the face. Your face spills blood as your head violently whips against the grass. You turn to her and she quickly jabs you in the chin. Your head spins and your muscles hurt. You grunt and try to untangle your broken, floating thoughts.<br><br>Nkaanmykiunsuns swiftly yanks you on your stomach and you feel thin, cold wire wrap around you wrists painfully. She mercilessly hogties you on the ground. As you regain your senses, she yanks on the wire and tightens the restraints one more time.

	[plead_dumb] Yup, I deserve all of this.
