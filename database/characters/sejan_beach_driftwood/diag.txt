NOTES


||
{start} You stumble upon some driftwood on the beach.
{examine_wood} The driftwood is clearly not from the peninsula, it's sturdier and more rigid than the spongy green trees that grow here. Some of the wood has been washed out further up on the beach and has dried out.

{axe_giant_club} You spent an inordinate amount of time axing and sometimes whittling the wood to create a colossal wooden club.<br><br>You wipe sweat off your brow and look at your handiwork. It's a really big club.
	[ | check_stat strength 8 test_giant_0-test_giant_1] (Give it a test swing)

{test_giant_0} You pick it up with a grunt and place it on your shoulder. You tense your arms and swing it across horizontally with an angry grunt. The momentum drags you down with the club and you fall face first into the sand.
