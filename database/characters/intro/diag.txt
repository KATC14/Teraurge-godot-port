{int_2 | start_music misc/intro_2 70, play_sound intro/intro_2 10, pic intro2, auto_continue int_3} You're roused by a warm feeling against your left cheek. You open one eye a crack, and you're surprised to see a small, blue orb of light floating above your bed. It hovers there, weightless and ethereal, twinkling in the gloom like a fallen star. Disregarding the strange phenomenon as a dream, you close your eyes again.

{int_3 | start_music misc/intro_3 70, play_sound intro/intro_3 30, pic intro3, auto_continue int_4} Suddenly, you feel something pulling on you, as if a kind of magnetism was attempting to drag you from your bed. Your blanket flutters as sheets of paper from your desk and small objects from your shelves fly about the room, as if lifted by an invisible hand or blown by a strong wind. The light that had appeared at the foot of your bed is now a gaping maw, the fabric of reality seeming to warp around it, like ripples of water on the surface of a lake. It casts you in its ghostly, blue light as your bed edges towards it, a horrible screeching ringing in your ears. Your fingers dig into your mattress as you feel your body begin to slide inexorably towards it.

{int_4 | start_music misc/intro_4 80, play_sound intro/intro_4 50, pic intro4, auto_continue int_5} Your struggle is in vain, however. The blue light grows more intense and your body is pulled violently into it. You close your eyes against the bright light as it engulfs you, blinded by the glow.

You open your mouth to let out a cry, but no sound comes, all that you can see in this endless darkness is a stone floor as it rushes up towards you.<br><br>An invisible force slows you at the last moment, and you tumble forth onto the flagstones, shaking your head in an attempt to dispel your dizziness as your eyes adjust to the light. You realize that you've emerged into some kind of a shack or a hovel, and a quick glance around reveals that you've been deposited into what looks like an alchemist's lab. There are illegible scribbles painted on the floor beneath you, a large iron cauldron sits in the middle of the room, and the space is strewn with all manners of books and oddities. Sitting atop wooden tables are chemistry sets, glass bottles of all shapes and sizes, even pieces of weird machinery the purpose of which you cannot fathom.<br><br>You're startled by a high-pitched scream that comes from somewhere behind you.
