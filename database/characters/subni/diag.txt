>>Subni is a small creature in the tavern that speaks in broken sentences and cheats money from the player.


||>>Intro
{start | start_music sejan_taodal/subni 70 3, save_index met} You walk up to the small thing, and the small creature motions for you to sit. "Hey! Hey! You! The biggie, you! You play a game? Chance adats, get more adats!" Its voice is a collection of oddly melodic clicks and screeches.
{met | start_music sejan_taodal/subni 70 3} "You back! Now we play adats?" She flashes her tiny fangs in glee.
{interested} "Yeh! Money game! Name Subni! We could play?"
{introduce} "Me Subni! I could answer some, maybe.<br><br>Wait! You play, and I'll answer one." Subni gives you a sly look.
{sorry_no_adats} "Game then later? Bye."
	[interested] Are you suggesting gambling? Playing for money? //hideif.clicked
	[introduce] Could I ask some questions? //hideif.clicked
	[lets_play] I'll play. Name's -name-. //showif.has_adats.1
	[sorry_no_adats] Sorry, I don't have any adats. //showif.no_adats //hideif.index_is.sorry_no_adats

{lets_play} "Aah! -name- like money games? Subni too! Game very simple. Agree bet, choose cup or sticks then throw Randticks on table. They jump, thrash, and make their face cup or sticks. More sticks or cups gets an adat."
{just_chance} "No! Makes it very fair! 100% random!"
{abit_dull} "It very simple but not bother. Randticks very flashy."
	[win_rigged] Okay, deal the Randticks.
	[just_chance] It's just based on chance? There's no skill element in it? //hideif.clicked
	[abit_dull] You just throw sticks and see what side comes up? Seems a bit dull. //hideif.clicked
||>>Intro Randtick win
{win_rigged | counter subni_earned_questions + 1} Subni smiles, excited. "Be cups or sticks?" She digs the Randticks from a bag and starts separating them.
	[win_cups] Cups.
	[win_sticks] Sticks.
||
{win_cups | play_sound sejan/subni_sticks_win 70, pic randticks} Subni divides the Randticks and shoves half over to you. "Take. We drop same time and see." Subni grabs a pile and holds it over the table. You take yours and mirror Subni. Subni nods and drops the Randticks on the table, you quickly do the same. Instead of just clacking on the table, the sticks explode into incredible chaos of sound and colored light. The Randticks jump and spin but never leave the table, as if they were tethered to the spot where they first fell. After a moment of fireworks, the sticks come to dead stop. Subni mutters, counting the cups and sticks. "Cups win! You win!"
