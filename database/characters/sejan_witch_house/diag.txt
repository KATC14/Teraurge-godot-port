{waited_fire | save_index burnt, stop_contsound 1 6, change_environment sejan_witch_house_burnt, advance_time_to morning} You watch the fire dance on the wood beams of the house and devour it slowly.

{search_rubble | add_flag witch_house_rubble_searched} You carefully step through the burnt wood and blackened bricks. After some searching among the wreckage, the only salvageable-looking things you find are an odd broken machine and a half-burnt book.
{take_cylinder | pic hut_ruin} You reach into the machine and tug the cylinder free. The light keeps blinking even when the cable attached to the cylinder detaches. You stash the cylinder.
{bury_witch | advance_time_to evening, pic burial} You bury the Witch behind the ruins of her house. You mark her grave with a large stone block taken from the rubble. The trees rustle in the wind as you watch the silent scene.

||
{broken_machine | pic broken_machine} You crouch to take a better look at the machine. The metal shell has cracked, and you can see into it. Most of the machinery inside the box has been melted and distorted by the fire. You spot a metallic cylinder with a slowly blinking light on it.

||
{look_for_body_1 | pic charred_corpse} You spend considerable time turning over the rubble, and then suddenly stumble on a black, hardened shape that resembles the Witch. You lift the rubble off it and notice it's missing its head.

	[leave_body] (Leave it)
