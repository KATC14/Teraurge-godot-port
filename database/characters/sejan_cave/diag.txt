{visited} The cave entrance looms ahead.
{survey_sur} The area is overgrown with vegetation aside from the bald spot right at the cave entrance. The cave itself doesn't seem artificial, but the dirt path leading to it is too packed and solid to be naturally occurring.
{left_cave | remove_pic} You emerge from the cave.
{left_cave_torch | remove_pic} You emerge from the cave and put out your torch.

{explore_cave | pic cave_inside} You walk towards the cave entrance. The darkness inside seems unnaturally persistent. The feeling of dread swells as you enter the cave. The cave seems eerily silent.

||
{venture_cave_1 | pic cave_dark} The cave is completely void of light. You take steps forward, and the darkness becomes smothering. You cannot see the cave walls anymore. You slide your hand along the wall as you move forward. You come to a stop when you hear echo of your steps coming from below. It sounds like there's a drop ahead.
{survey_drop_dark} You carefully take small steps until you reach the lip of the drop. You extend your foot to measure the depth of the drop but cannot find the bottom. The strong draft and echoes indicate it's a deep drop. The walls are rough stone, but they offer no handholds. You step away from the drop.

{rope_descend | pic cave_chamber, add_flag pc_sejan_cave_visited} You climb down the rope and reach the bottom of the drop. You land in a chamber with a complex maze of tunnels leading in every direction.
{return_to_rope | pic cave_chamber} You return to the chamber where the rope is.
{survey_tunnels} The cave has dizzying amounts of tunnels in every direction. It seems to have formed naturally. You cannot see any points of interests in the mess.
