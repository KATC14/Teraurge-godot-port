# this port is half finished and %90 of it does not work
I don't know when I'm going to get around to working on it again so I'm uploading it as it is, there is a log of bugs and is super unfinished
don't complain to me when it doesn't work right its not meant to be played in this state

this for me was a introduction to using godot I had never used it prior to this I only had some experience in python (mostly tkinter so grain of salt)

link to the [original game](https://teraurge.blogspot.com/) this is only a port to godot trying to recreate the look of the original game no new content
